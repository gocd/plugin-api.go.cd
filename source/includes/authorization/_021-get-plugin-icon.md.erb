<aside class="notice">
  <strong>It is recommended that:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>The image be an SVG image, since it scales well. Using other types like PNG/JPEG/GIF/BMP will work too, but is not recommended.</li>
    <li>The image be a square image.</li>
    <li>The base-64 encoded data is &lt;= 100KB. Bigger sizes will work too, but may take a long time to render.</li>
  </ul>
