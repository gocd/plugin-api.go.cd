## Validate Profile

This call is expected to validate the user inputs that form a part of the elastic agent profile.

<p class='request-name-heading'>Request name</p>

`go.cd.elastic-agent.validate-profile`

<p class='request-body-heading'>Request body</p>

The request body will contain a JSON object with the keys and values that form part of the profile.

> An example validation request body for the docker elastic agent plugin

```json
{
  "Image": "alpine:latest",
  "MaxMemory": "foo"
}
```

<p class='response-code-heading'>Response code</p>

The plugin is expected to return status `200` if it can understand the request.

<p class='response-body-heading'>Response Body</p>

> The plugin should respond with JSON array response for each configuration key that has a validation error

```json
[
  {
   "key": "MaxMemory",
   "message": "'foo' is not a valid value for `MaxMemory`."
  }
]
```

If any of the input keys have a validation error on them, the plugin is expected to return a list of [validation error objects](#the-validation-error-object). If the profile is valid, the plugin should return an empty JSON array.
