<p>Welcome to the GoCD Plugin API! You can use this API to implement GoCD plugins for:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="analytics">Analytics</a></li>
<li><a href="artifacts">Artifacts</a></li>
<li><a href="authorization">Authorization</a></li>
<li><a href="config-repo">Config repositories</a></li>
<li><a href="elastic-agents">Elastic agents</a></li>
<li><a href="notifications">Notifications</a></li>
<li><a href="package-repo">Package Repositories</a></li>
<li><a href="scm">SCMs</a></li>
<li><a href="tasks">Tasks</a></li>
<li><a href="secrets">Secrets</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Plugins, as the name implies, help in extending the functionality of GoCD. GoCD publishes a list of extension points for
which plugins can be provided. An extension point published by the GoCD - defines the interface and the lifecycle that
governs the respective plugin. At present only Java based extension points and plugins are supported by GoCD, but the
interface is simple enough for anyone to build plugins in other languages using a simple HTTP bridge.</p>

<h1 id="plugin-packaging-structure">Plugin packaging structure</h1>

<p>Plugins can be packaged as standalone jar or a combination of multiple plugins in a jar know as plugin bundle. To know
more about the packaging jar is explained in the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="plugin-structure#structure-of-a-gocd-plugin">GoCD plugin</a></li>
<li><a href="plugin-structure#structure-of-a-plugins-bundle">GoCD plugins bundle</a></li>
</ul>

          <h1 id="api-changelog">API Changelog</h1>
